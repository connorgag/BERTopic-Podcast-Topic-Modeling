# BERTopic Podcast Topic Modeling
### Connor Gag

All code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook called Final_Project_Code.ipynb

Running this code will either create the following items or pull them from local storage:
- transcripts
- models
- model results (extracted topics and the classified topic for each batch)

Must have an OpenAI key for the topic name enhancements to work.
